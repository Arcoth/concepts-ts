https://github.com/cplusplus/concepts-ts is the repository for the 
C++ Technical Specification "Extensions for Concepts". 

For the most recent draft of the lists generated from these files,
see http://cplusplus.github.com/concepts-ts/. The active issues
list can be found at: http://cplusplus.github.com/concepts-ts/ts-active.html.

The Technical Specification concepts is found in the `src` directory
and is written in LaTeX. There is a Makefile that can be used to compile
the sources.

An earlier version of the specification can be found in the `html` directory;
it was written in HTML using a Javascript/CSS framework for formatting.
This is *not* the current version of the document.
