<p>
We have a broad concern that the ambiguity for a reader between a
constrained function template without a template-introducer and a "regular"
function will make the language unnecessarily difficult to teach, read, and
maintain code. We note that a TS is the perfect vehicle to have an experiment 
to establish if these concerns are real, but want to exercise caution as we 
proceed, and be sure that there is a real feedback plan in place before 
considering moving this feature from a TS and into a future standard.

Suggest opening an EWG issue.
