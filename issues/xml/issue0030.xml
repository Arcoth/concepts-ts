<title>Normalization wording guarantees worst case performance for subsumption</title>

<p>
The current wording for normalization guarantees exponential performance
during subsumption.
</p>

<p>
Addressing this issue first requires that we address issue <iref ref="29"/>.
If concepts can be safely evaluated in any context, then we do not need to
lift the entire constraint into the current instantiation.
</p>

<p>
The current phrasing also prohibits certain compiler optimizations by requiring
a full expansion to atomic constraints. In particular, this does not admit
early termination of the algorithm or memoization of comparisons.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the Skillman concepts meeting, there was a much more abstract wording
for the subsumption algorithm. One resolution would be to revert the current
wording to the older version.
