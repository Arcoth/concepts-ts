It seems unfortunate that concepts cannot be declared as members of class
templates. This seemingly makes it impossible to define concepts for
constraining multiple template parameter packs (if concepts as static member
functions were possible, one could provide e.g. two packs so that the class
template gets the first pack and the member function template gets the
second. That can't be done with a namespace scope concept because multiple
packs in function templates require deduction, and concepts  don't take
arguments that could be deduced.). As an example, practical needs for such
constraining arise in standard library implementations, when constraining
the variadic converting constructors of  <code>std::tuple</code>.

Suggest opening an EWG issue.
