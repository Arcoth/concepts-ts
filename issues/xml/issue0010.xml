<p>
There are too many redundant ways to express the same set of requirements.
While each presents a reasonable use-case in isolation, the combined effect is
overwhelming.

Proposed solution: Review the overlapping syntaxes, and eliminate those
that add least value, or are least frequently used. This may mean shipping 
the TS in close to its current form to obtain such feedback though.

Suggest opening an EWG issue.
