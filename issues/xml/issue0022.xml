<title>Initializers are never <i>constraint-expression</i>s</title>

<p>
Initializers [dcl.init] are not expressions. However bullet 6.3 in
[dcl.spec.concept] has a requirement where an "initializer shall be a
constraint-expression".
</p>

<p>
Presumably the constraint is that the initializer shall have exactly one full-
expression (that is,
<pre>
<code>
template &lt;typename T&gt; concept bool C{};
</code>
</pre>
is ill-formed), and that said full-expression is valid where a
<i>constraint-expression</i> is required.
</p>

<p>
It also seems that C++14 subclause 8.5 [dcl.init] paragraph 2 should be removed
or updated to exclude objects declared with the concept specifier in a manner
similar to how it excludes objects declared with the constexpr specifier.
