<p>
The syntactic distinction between a function concept  and a variable concept
seems to serve no useful  purpose. A single concept syntax seems sufficient,
and especially so once redundant elements are removed.

Merge the two concept forms into one, streamlining the syntax by eliminating 
at least the following redundant elements: explicit bool (see comment below), 
explicit return, and the always empty parentheses constituting the function
parameter list.

Also see issues <iref ref="6"/> and <iref ref="8"/> as they relate.

Suggest opening an EWG issue.
