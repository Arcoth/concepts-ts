<!-- Code Block
  Code block elements are used to wrap program fragments in C++. The
  element is partially formatted for improved rendering by removing
  leading and trailing whitespace that is generally annoying in
  <pre> blocks.

  Also, without this, <pre> block was being rendered outside of examples.
  That's not desirable.

  TODO: If somebody was clever, this could shell out to a code highlighter
  and actually return C++ code wrapped with html tags for formatting
  things like comments, etc.
